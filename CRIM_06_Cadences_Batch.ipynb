    "## C. Find Cadences with Modular Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Alex Morgan has built a powerful tool that identifies cadences according to the combinations of two-voice **modules** that describe the typical contrapuntal motion between the various **cadential voice functions** (**CVF**) heard in Renaissance polyphony:  **cantizans and tenorizans**, **cantizans and bassiszans**, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tool uses modular analysis to identify **conjunctions** of these pairs in order to predict cadences of various kinds. But there are many combinations, especially once we consider that voices functions (or roles) can be **displaced** (as when the tenorizans role appears in the Superius part and the cantizans appears in the Tenor part), or through **irregular** motion, and even **interrupted**, as when a voice is suddenly silent. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can in fact check all of the cadential voice functions (CVFs) for a given piece below.  But Alex's system also conveniently **labels** the cadences according to **type**, **tone**, **evaded** and also provides information about the relative place within the piece, the adjacent cadences, and many other features, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:  **Measure** and **Beat** columns are in the body of the table, not at the Index.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Column Headings Explained**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **Low** and **Tone** columns give the pitches of the **lowest sounding pitch (in any voice) at the perfection**, and the **goal tone of the cantizans** (or altizans if there is no cantizans) respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **RelLow** is the lowest pitch of each cadence shown as an interval measured against the last pitch in the **Low** column. Likewise, **RelTone** is the cadential tone shown as an interval measured against the last pitch in the **Tone** column.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **SinceLast** and **ToNext** columns are the time in quarter notes since the last or to the next cadence.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **Progress** column is a relative indication of position in the piece.  **0** is the beginning of the piece; **1.0** is the end of the piece.\n",
