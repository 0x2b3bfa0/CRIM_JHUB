## CRIM Intervals Notebooks
These Jupyter notebooks allow users to explore musical patterns with **CRIM Intervals**, part of **Citations:  The Renaissance Imitation Mass** (www.crimproject.org), directed by **Richard Freedman** (contact him at rfreedma at haverford dot edu for further information).

In them, you will find various routines to load encoded musical scores, then find various kinds of melodic, rhythmic, harmonic, and contrapuntal patterns using Python and Pandas code.  These tools build on the important **music21** (https://web.mit.edu/music21/), a Python Library created by **Myke Cuthbert** at the Massachuesetts Institute of Technology.

The code found here is the work of many hands, including **Frederick Gould** (Haverford College '22), **Trang Dang** (Bryn Mawr College '22) and **Linh Le** (Bryn Mawr College '23), with guidance and additional development by **Alexander Morgan** (USA) and **Daniel Russo-Batterham** (Melbourne, Australia).

All code, encoded scores and commentaries developed for the **CRIM Project** remain the intellectual property of the various authors, who have nevertheless assigned copyright to **Haverford College**.
